URGENT: Hydration Isses
URGENT: Leaflet Pos issues

WildFire Banner thingy goes away after clicking dangermap elements (i think it should remain)
Missing Map on Phone like the map isnt visible only the data rn weird (Take screenshot)
mobile compativility for PWA

if new tmeperature is rpeorted for same location update current dont add a new one (but if location is different then ofc thats a new case)
Avg Temp and High risk zones update
Click on a fire area view details button doesnt work
Your lcoation should give long and latitude 
if the droneâ€™s last recorded location is within 5km of its first location, it simply updates the existing data, but if it moves beyond 5km, it creates a new blocked region.
All zones doesnt work (like in updating how many there are and an accordigon to collapse them and onload they overlfow and become hidden but once u click location then they adjust to view weird bug)
